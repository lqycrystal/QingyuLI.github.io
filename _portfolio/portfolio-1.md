Building footprints are essential for understanding urban dynamics. However, high resolution building footprint maps are unavalaible for many less developed regions. Planet satellite imagery with daily repetition frequency and high resolution has opened new opportunities for building mapping at large scales. So, the goal of the task in this project is

* Development of frameworks for global building footprint generation;
