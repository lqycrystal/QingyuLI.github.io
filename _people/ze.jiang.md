I am a researcher. My research focuses on remote sensing image understanding and urban analysis. I mainly use deep learning methods and statistical tools to carry out my research works. 
More info about me can be found in [CV](https://lqycrystal.github.io/qingyuli.github.io/cv/) or [downloaded CV](https://github.com/lqycrystal/qingyuli.github.io/blob/main/files/qingyulicv.pdf).
