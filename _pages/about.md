This is Qingyu Li's personal homepage. Please also refer to [my homepage in Technical University of Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sipeo/team/qingyu-li/). 

## A short introduction
I am a Research Associate in the chair of [Data Science in Earth Observation, Techinical Univeristy of Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sipeo/home/) working in the field of remote sensing. I submitted my Ph.D. thesis in June, 2022, and the topic is “Deep Learning for Building Footrpint Generation from Optical Imagery”. I received my B.Eng. in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing from Wuhan University, China; I obtained my double Master Degree,which is ESPACE, TUM, Germany and  Photogrammetry and remote sensing, Wuhan University, China.
