This is Qingyu Li's personal homepage. Please also refer to [my homepage in Technical University of Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sipeo/team/qingyu-li/). 

## A short introduction
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the chair of [Data Science in Earth Observation, Technical University of Munich](https://www.asg.ed.tum.de/sipeo/home/) working in the field of remote sensing. I received my Ph.D. from Technical University of Munich. The topic of my dissertation is “Deep Learning for Building Footrpint Generation from Optical Imagery”. I received my Bachelor degree in Remote Sensing Science and Technology from Wuhan University, China; I obtained my double Master Degree, which are (1) ESPACE, Technical University of Munich, Germany and (2) Photogrammetry and remote sensing, Wuhan University, China. 

<b>Research Interests:</b>
